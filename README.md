Image processing &amp; dataviz using Pillow, Matplotlib and NumPy

In preparation for my PhD research on Twitter images and misinformation, I need to learn how to manipulate and visualise images in datasets.
This project is an example of using various techniques to manipulate images of bees. 
Later I will look at how to classify images like this using machine learning models.
